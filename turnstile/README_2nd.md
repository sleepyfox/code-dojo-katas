# Turnstile kata, part 2

Now that you've implemented the first part of the kata, create a new folder and create a different program that simulates a safe.

* A safe has two states: locked and unlocked;
* The safe has a keypad with the letters A to F on it;
* A code consisting of entering the sequence of keypresses D, E, A and D must be entered in the correct order in order for the safe to be unlocked;
* There is no indication that a correct key has been pressed;
* There is recognisable feedback when the safe is unlocked;
* Any incorrect keypress will reset the sequence and force the opener to start again;
* There is no indication that the opener has entered an incorrect key press;
* Shutting the door of the safe after it has been opened will automatically lock it.

Implement the programme using TDD before moving on to the [third part](README_3rd.md).
